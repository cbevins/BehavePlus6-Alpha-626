1.  What are BehavePlus geographic place name files?

BehavePlus includes a Sun-Moon Calendar Tool that determines
the date and time of seasonal and daily astronomical events
for a specified location on the planet.  The calendar (invoked
from the "Tools->Sun-moon calendar" menu option) depends upon
precise geographic coordinates to determine sun and moon rise-
set and civil dawn-dusk with about 1 minute accuracy (assuming
an unobstructed view to the horizon).  The times are in
agreement with those published by the US Naval Observatory.

BehavePlus uses Geographic Place Name files (*.geo) to assign
geographic coordinates to named locations on the planet.  Any
file within the <INSTALLDIR>/DocFolder/GeoFolder directory with
a ".geo" file extension is assumed to be a BehavePlus
Geographic Place Name file and will automatically appear in the
Calendar's Location Browse list.


2.  What geographic place name files are available?

BehavePlus is distributed with only 2 example geographic place
name file; Montana.geo and Special.geo.

Additional *.geo files for all 50 U.S. states, the District of
Columbia, the Caribbean, and Oceania are packaged in the
USGeoPlaces.exe setup program available from www.fire.org.

Simply download and execute this file, being sure to specify the
same installation directory as you did for BehavePlus, and the
place name files will be installed in the appropriate folder and
should appear in the Calendar's Location->Browse list.

The files contain data for over 40,000 U.S. geographic names
compiled from the USGS "U.S. Concise File" of major physical and
cultural features in the U.S. and its territories.  The data
sets are available from www.nmd-usgs.gov/www/gnis.


3.  What other data sets are available?

None.  But you are certainly invited to compile a geographic
place name file for your country, state, province, etc. and
share it with the rest of us!  One place to start looking for
existing data is the USGS web site mentioned above, other
geographic place name server sites, or simply by searching
the world wide web.

You can compile a file by country or by state/province.  You
probably don't want a file with more than a few thousand names.

Compile the data using the format described below.  When
completed, be sure to let me know so we can share it with
others via the www.fire.org web site.


4.  What is the format of the geographic place name files?

Geographic place name files are simple ASCII text files with
one line per geographic location.  The record format is:

Beg  End  Len  Description
  1   50   50  Place name
 51   51    1  Blank
 52   60    9  Type (see below)
 61   61    1  Blank
 62   92   31  County, district
 93   93    1  Blank
 94  109   16  State, province
110  110     1 Blank
111  117    7  Latitude in "DDMMSSH" format where
                   DD - degrees (pad with leading zeros)
				   MM - minutes (pad with leading zeros)
				   SS - seconds (pad with leading zeros)
				   H - hemisphere "N" or "S" of equator
118  125    8  Longitude in "DDDMMSSH" format where
                   DDD - degrees (pad with leading zeros)
				   MM - minutes (pad with leading zeros)
				   SS - seconds (pad with leading zeros)
				   H - hemisphere "W" or "E" of Greenwich Merid
126  126    1  Blank
127  131    5  Elevation (ft)
                   Currently this is simply informational and
				   is not used in any computations.  But since
				   this could change in the future, if you wish
				   to use meters, please append an "m" to the
				   value; e.g. "1234m".
132  133    2  Blank
134  136    3  Standard time difference (hours) from Greenwich
                   Mean Time.  Locations east of GMT generally
				   have a negative value.

from one of the other files.
