The original 13 standard fire behavior fuel models are described in Anderson
(1982).  These fuel models were used by Albini (1976) to develop the
nomograms published in his paper <I>Estimating wildfire behavior and effects</I>.
<P>
This fuel model key is from Rothermel (1983).

<OL>
  <LI><i>Determine the general vegetation type</i>, i.e., grass, brush, timber 
    litter, or slash.</LI>
  <LI><i>Estimate which stratum of surface fuel is most likely to carry the spreading 
    fire.</i> </LI>
  <ul>
    <LI> For instance, the fire may be in a timbered area, but the timber is relatively 
      open and the dead grass, not needle litter, would carry the fire. In this 
      case, fuel model 2, which is not listed as a timber model, should be considered. 
    </LI>
    <LI>In the same area if the grass is sparse and there is no wind or slope, 
      the needle litter would be the stratum carrying the fire and fuel model 
      9 would be a better choice.</LI>
  </ul>
  <LI><i>Note the general depth and compactness of the fuel.</i> This information 
    will be needed when using the fuel model key. These are very important considerations, 
    particularly in the grass and timber types.</LI>
  <LI><i>Determine which fuel classes are present and estimate their influence 
    on fire behavior.</i> </LI>
  <ul>
    <LI>For instance, green fuel may be present, but will it play a significant 
      role in fire behavior? </LI>
    <LI>Large fuels may be present, but are they sound or decaying and breaking 
      up? </LI>
    <LI>Do they have limbs and twigs attached or are they bare cylinders? </LI>
    <LI>You must look for fine fuels and choose a model that represents their 
      depth, compactness, and to some extent, the amount of live fuel and its 
      contribution to fire. </LI>
    <LI>Do not be restricted by the fuel model name or category.</LI>
  </ul>
  <LI>Using these observations, <i>proceed through the fuel model key and the 
    descriptions provided by Anderson (1982) to select a model.</i></LI>
