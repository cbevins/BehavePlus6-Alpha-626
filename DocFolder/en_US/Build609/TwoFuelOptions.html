<P> The two-fuel model options are useful for areas that clearly consist of two 
  different fuel models rather than a single, homogenous fuel model. These two 
  fuel models are designated as "first" and "second". The coverage is entered 
  for the "first" fuel model only. The coverage of the "second" fuel model is 
  the remainder, with the total being 100%. 
<P>
The two fuel model options work with standard or custom fuel models, but
not with the <I>palmetto-gallberry</I>, <I>western aspen</I>, or <I>fuel parameters</I> options.

    <TD width="30%" valign="top"><I>Two fuel models, 2-dimensional expected spread (recommended).</I></TD>
    <TD width="65%"> 
      <P> This is the preferred method for two fuel models. The expected spread 
        rate through the fuel complex is estimated by examining all possible spread 
        paths through a matrix of fuels, which allows the fire to burn around, 
        rather than through, patches of slower burning fuels (see Finney 2002). 
      <P> This method assumes that the size of the fire is much larger than the 
        size of the fuel patches (that is, that the fire will spread through many 
        fuel patches). It may be more accurate in situations where one fuel type 
        is much flashier than the other, and the distribution pattern of the fuels 
        gives the fire the opportunity to burn around slower burning fuel patches 
        (such as randomly arranged patches). 
    </TD>
  </TR>
  <TR> 
    <TD width="30%" valign="top"><I>Two fuel models, harmonic mean.</I></TD>
    <TD width="65%"> 
      <P> This method is applied to situations where the fire will burn through 
        alternating bands of the two fuel types (such as burning up an elevation 
        gradient or through a fuel modification zone). That is, the fire must 
        burn through one band to reach the next, and has no opportunity to spread 
        around the slower burning fuel model. 
      <p> This method assumes that the size of the fire is much larger than the 
        size of the fuel bands, the fire will spread through many fuel bands, 
        and the fire is unable to spread around them. This is not a common situation.

    <TD width="30%" valign="top"><I>Two fuel models, area weighted (like old BEHAVE).</I></TD>
    <TD width="65%"> 
      <P> This method is appropriate when considering the average spread rate 
        of many fires located on a fuelscape composed of any arrangement of two 
        fuel models if the size of the fire is small compared to the size of the 
        fuel patches (this is, there is no spread between fuel patches). 
      <p> This method simply weights the spread rate of each fuel model by its 
        coverage. It is identical to the old BEHAVE method.

<P> For all of the two fuel model options, fire behavior is reported according 
  to the table below. If you would like to see the actual fire behavior for each fuel 
  model, create a Run for each fuel model. 
<P> The primary purpose of the two fuel model option is to provide weighted rate 
  of spread. It is not appropriate to weight fire intensity values or their derivatives 
  such as flame length or scorch height. The table below lists the rules used to report 
  results for the two fuel model option. Variables on the Intermediate and Fuel Output tabs are not available.<BR>
