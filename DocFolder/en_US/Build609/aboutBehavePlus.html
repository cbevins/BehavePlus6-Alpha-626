<P> Current information about the BehavePlus Fire Modeling System can be found 
  on <B>www.firemodels.org</B> where you can download the latest version of the program and documentation. 
  Tutorials and a list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) are also available on the website. <br><br>

    <H3><FONT COLOR="#ff5500">Bug Reports</FONT></H3>
<P> BehavePlus is a large, complex program, and problems such as bugs and crashes 
  will inevitably occur. If you discover bugs in BehavePlus or if the program 
  crashes or freezes up, please take the following steps: 
<OL>
  <LI> Repeat the sequence of events that led to the problem. If you cannot repeat 
    the problematic behavior, then we cannot investigate it. We can only fix a 
    problem if we can replicate it.</LI>
  <LI> Record the sequence of keystrokes (selected run files, modules, and options; 
    worksheet inputs, etc.) that led to the problem.</LI>
  <LI> Contact the <b>Fire Applications Help Desk, U.S. Forest Service, Fire and Aviation Management</b> 
    via phone (<b>800-253-5559</b> or <b>208-387-5290</b>), fax (<b>208-387-5292</b>) or e-mail (<b>helpdesk@dms.nwcg.gov</b>). 
    They will assist you in reporting issues to the developers or in fixing the 
    problem if a solution has been found.</LI>
  <LI>If this is a newly discovered bug, we will work to resolve the issue in 
    the most expedient manner possible (e.g., through a re-release of the current 
    version or in an upcoming version). In some cases, these issues may not be 
    immediately resolvable, so we will attempt to create a work-around solution 
    for the problem.</LI>
  <LI>All information on bugs and crashes will be posted on our website under 
    &quot;Known Bugs&quot;, the &quot;FAQs&quot;, and/or the &quot;Downloads&quot; 
    pages. </LI>

<P> Monte Dolack is a nationally recognized artist from Missoula, MT, whose artwork 
  decorates the pages of BehavePlus. We are pleased to show details of some of 
  Monte's work in an attempt to partially relieve the visual tediousness of the 
  modern windows-style GUI. Monte has gained national recognition for his poster 
  designs, which often contain allusions to environmental concerns. He paints 
  in acrylics, oils, and watercolors, and also works in traditional printmaking 
  techniques. Monte's posters and note cards may be viewed and ordered via his 
  website at <b>www.dolack.com</b>.<br>
