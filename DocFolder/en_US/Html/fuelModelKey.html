<p>The original 13 standard fire behavior fuel models are described in Anderson (1982).  These fuel models were used by Albini (1976b) to develop the nomograms published in his paper <i>Estimating wildfire behavior and effects</i>. The 40 fuel models are described by Scott and Burgan (2005).</p>

<h3><font color="#ff5500">General Considerations when Selecting a Fuel Model</font></h3>

<ol>
  <li><i>Determine the general vegetation type</i>, i.e., grass, brush, timber litter, or slash.</li>
  <li><i>Estimate which stratum of surface fuel is most likely to carry the spreading fire.</i> </li>
	  <ul>
		<li> For instance, the fire may be in a timbered area, but the timber is relatively open and the dead grass, not needle litter, would carry the fire. In this 
		  case, fuel model 2, which is not listed as a timber model, should be considered.</li>
		<li>In the same area if the grass is sparse and there is no wind or slope, the needle litter would be the stratum carrying the fire and fuel model 9 may be a better choice.</li>
	  </ul>
  <li><i>Note the general depth and compactness of the fuel.</i> This information will be needed when using the fuel model key. These are very important considerations, 
    particularly in the grass and timber types.</li>
  <li><i>Determine which fuel classes are present and estimate their influence on fire behavior.</i> </li>
	  <ul>
		<li>For instance, green fuel may be present. Will it play a significant role in fire behavior? </li>
		<li>Large fuels may be present, but are they sound or decaying and breaking up? </li>
		<li>Do they have limbs and twigs attached or are they bare cylinders? </li>
		<li>You must look for fine fuels and choose a model that represents their depth, compactness, and to some extent, the amount of live fuel and its 
		  contribution to fire. </li>
		<li>Do not be restricted by the fuel model name or category.</li>
	  </ul>
  <li>Using these observations, <i>proceed through the fuel model key and the descriptions provided by <a href="#Table1">Rothermel (1983)</a> or <a href="#Table2">Scott and Burgan (2005)</a> to select a model.</i></li>
