<h3><font color="#ff5500">Bug Reports</font></h3>

<p>BehavePlus is a large, complex program, and problems such as bugs and crashes will inevitably occur. If you discover bugs in BehavePlus or if the program 
	crashes or freezes up, please take the following steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Repeat the sequence of events that led to the problem. If you cannot repeat the problematic behavior, then we cannot investigate it. We can only fix a problem if we can replicate it.</li>
  <li>Record the sequence of keystrokes (selected run files, modules, and options; worksheet inputs, etc.) that led to the problem.</li>
  <li>If possible, save a copy of the worksheet or run to send to the developers.</li>
  <li>Contact the <b>Fire Applications Help Desk, USDA Forest Service, Fire and Aviation Management</b> for assistance. Check our website <strong>www.frames.gov/behaveplus</strong> under the &quot;Support&quot; tab for the latest contact information. They will assist you in reporting issues to the developers or in fixing the problem if a solution has been found.</li>
  <li>If this is a newly discovered bug, we will work to resolve the issue in the most expedient manner possible (e.g., through a re-release of the current version or in an upcoming version). In some cases, these issues may not be immediately resolvable, so we will attempt to create a work-around solution for the problem.</li>
  <li>All information on bugs and crashes will be posted on our website under the &quot;Support&quot; (FAQs and Known Bugs documents) tab.</li>
</ol>

<h3><font color="#ff5500">Monte Dolack Paintings</font></h3>
<p>Monte Dolack is a nationally recognized artist from Missoula, MT, whose artwork decorates the pages of BehavePlus. We are pleased to show details of some of Monte's work in an attempt to partially relieve the visual tediousness of the modern windows-style GUI. Monte has gained national recognition for his poster designs, which often contain allusions to environmental concerns. He paints in acrylics, oils, and watercolors, and also works in traditional printmaking techniques. Monte's posters and note cards may be viewed and ordered via his website at <b>www.dolack.com</b>.</p>
