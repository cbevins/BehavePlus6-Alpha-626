<P>The flame length of a spreading surface fire within the flaming front is measured from midway in the active flaming combustion zone to the average tip of the flames.
<p>"Flame length is an elusive parameter that exists in the eye of the beholder. It is a poor quantity to use in a scientific or engineering sense, but it is so readily apparent to fireline personnel and so readily conveys a sense of fire intensity that it is worth featuring as a primary fire variable." (Rothermel 1991). </p>
<p>Fireline intensity and flame length are related to the heat felt by a person standing next to the flames. Flame length is calculated from fireline intensity, which is a function of rate of spread and heat per unit area.</p>
<p>Flame length is used as a worst-case estimation of flame height for safety zone size calculations in SAFETY. The head fire flame length is always used.
</p>
