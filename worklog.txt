=============================

2018-05-23 [1.0 h]

- Responded to a request from FAH to make some debugger runs
	on SRExampleStandB.

2018-03-25 [2.0 h]

- Upload bp_626.msi, ReleaseNotes.txt, Build_626.zip

- Refresh Worksheet, Run, Fuel Model, Moisture Scenario files

- Created new Build 626 (Beta 3)

- Created new zip file Build_626.zip with all source and supporting files.

 
2018-03-12 [1.0 h]

-	Tested changes to the File Save As dialogs.

-	Updated the ReleaseNotes.txt.

-	Wrote an email to FAH about schedule for Build 626 release.


2018-03-11 [2.0 h]

- Made fixes to all the file 'save' operations so that
	(1) the Run Descipription (whether entered/tabbed or not)
	is used as the default file description, and that
	(2) the 'save' dialog file description field text,
	(whether enetered/tabbed or not) is used as the final
	file description, and that
	(3) the original Run Description text is properly restored
	to the worksheet after the file has been saved.
	
- Applied the above fixes to the following file save dialogs::
	- BpDocument::saveAsFuelModelFile()
	- BpDocument::saveAsMoistureScenarioFile()
	- BpDocument::saveAsRunFile()
	- BpDocument::saveAsUnitsSetFile()
	- BpDocument::saveAsWorksheetFile()

	
2018-03-10 [5.0 h]

- Revised BpDocument::saveAsWorksheetFile() and
  FileSaveAsDialog::FileSaveAsDialog() to scrape uncommitted
  entry fields (i.ew., fields with edited text bu no <Enter>
  or <Tab> to force storage).  SDaved run and file
  descriptions are now handle properly.
  
- Created zipit.bat file to generate Build zip files
	Usage: zipit <buildNumber>
	
- Added "appApplyPropertyXmlOverrides" boolean configuration
	parameter to BehavePlus6.xml around line 21961.
	If "true", the current Workspace (usually DefaultDataFolder)
	is searched for "property.xml", and if found, loads its
	properties into the application.

-- Added "crownConfDisplayPowerVariables" boolean configuration
	parameter to BehavePlus6.xml around line 22861.
	If "true", the Configure > CROWN > Fire Type Outputs tab displays
	"Power of the Fire", "Power of the Wind", "Power Ratio", and
	"Wind Driven Fire?" as available outputs,
	AND the Configure > Custom Units Preferences > Fire & Effects Units
	dialog displays the "Power" units field.

- Added "surfaceConfDisplayIntermediateDirectionsTab" boolean
	configuration parameter to BehavePlus6.xml around line 24378.
	If "true", the SURFACE Output Variables configuration dialog
	display the "Intermediate Directions" tab.

- Added "containConfSizeLimit" integer configuration parameter
	to BehavePlus6.xml to set CONTAIN fire size limt (10,000 ac).

- Added "containConfTimeLimit" integer configuration parameter
	to BehavePlus6.xml to set CONTAIN fire size limt (10,000 ac).

- Replaced the following Doc files with newest versions from FAH:
	fireUnits.html
	Models_BehavePlus.html
	variableIndex.html
	figureIndex.html
	vCrownFireActiveFireLineInt.html
	vCrownFireActiveFlameLeng.html
	vCrownFireActiveHeatPerUnitArea.html
	vCrownFireActiveSpreadRate.html
	vSurfaceFireHeatPerUnitArea.html
	vTreeCanopyBulkDens.html
	vTreeCrownBaseHt.html
	vWindSpeedAt20Ft.html

- Updated BehavePlus6.cpp to "Build 626 Beta 3"

- Create following wix packaging files:
	- wix_bp6_component_datafolder_626.wxs
	- wix_bp6_component_docfolder_626.wxs
	- wix_bp6_product_626.wxs,
	- wixcandle_626.bat
	- wixlight_626.bat


2018-03-09 [2.0 h]

- Tracked down reason the new 10,000 ac CONTAIN fire size limit
was always being reset to 1000.  The culprit was the property.xml
file inside the DefaultDataFolder, which was resetting the
BehavePlus6.xml value from 10000 to 1000.


2018-03-07 [4.0 h]

- Reviewed issue #102FAH CONTAIN Single Resource.
Tracked down differences between V5 and V6 CONTAIN code.

- Wrote email to FAH that V6 CONTAIN is government-supplied
source code from Issue #096TD - New CONTAIN Code.

- Determined that the cause of Issue #102 was that V6 CONTAIN
imposes a 1000 ac fire size limit on CONTAIN, at which point
resources are WITHDRAWN.  The example run supplied with the
issue results in fire sizes greater than 1000 ac at containment.

- Wrote FAH an email describing the situation and asking for
her preferred size and time limit values.

and C++ and PHP calculations of R'sa, O'active.


2017-10-12 [8.0 h]

- Tracked down cause of bug of two issues:
	-- S&R Eq 19 actually requires Ir as kJ/m2-min
		instead of kW/m2 (kJ/m2-s) as stated in Table 1.
	-- FAH instructions for R'sa say to use FM10 and waf=0.4
		instead of actual surface fuel model and waf

- Re-implemented O'active method using native Rothermel units

-- RESOLVED ISSUE 101FAH Table Row Header has the word "fuel" twice.


------------------------------------------------
NOTES ON THE SCOTT & REINHARDT CROWN FIRE MODEL
------------------------------------------------

- Equation 8 for R'active includes the phiS term, which should be 0,
	as Rothermel assumes wind is blowing upslope.

- Equation 15 uses 54.683 instead of 54.681 for km/h to ft/min conversion factor.

- Equation 19 actually requires Ir as kJ/m2-min instead of kW/m2 (kJ/m2-s)
	as stated in Table 1.

- Equation 20 for O'active uses FM10 wind K of 0.001612 instead of 0.0016102.

- Equation 20 for O'active uses 1/wind B of 0.7 instead of 0.698897

- Equation 20 for O'active assume wind is blowing upslope,
	and provides inaccurrate results if wind is blowing cross slope.

- Table 6 units for HPAsurface are actually in mega-Joules, not kiloJourles
 
- As a stand-alone model, S&R crown fire requires the following inputs:
	- wind speed at 20-ft
	- 1-h, 10-h, 100-h, and live stem fuel moistures
	- canopy foliage fuel moisture
	- canopy bulk density
	- canopy base height
	- canopy height
	- canopy heat of combustion
	- Surface fire heat per unit area
	- Surface fire fireline intensity (or flame length)
	- Surface fire spread no-wind no-slope rate
	- Surface fuel wind factor B
	- Surface fuel wind factor K
	- Surface fuel wind adjustment factor
	- Surface fire slope coefficient (phiS)
	- Surface fire reaction intensity

TO-DO

- Ensure S&R CROWN is available when linked to SURFACE.
- Ensure wind blows upslope when S&R is active.

- RESOLVED ISSUE #093 - X Axis Variable Names Don't Appear...


---- ISSUE#092FAH - CONTAIN Outputs -----------------------------

- Researched into this issue and wrote the following response to FAH:


The BP Contain model is based entirely on the Fried and Fried model, which has the following behavior:

1. More than a single resource (crew, engine, etc) with various productivity rates may be dispatched at various times as specified by user input.

2. If the productivity of the very first resource that arrives is so insufficient that it would be overrun by the fire, it's initial attack is delayed until the next resource arrives.

3.  When the next resource arrives, its productivity is accumulated, and we again test if the combined resources are overrun.

4.  If the combined resources are overrun
4a  and MORE resources are yet to arrive, loop back to step 3.
4b  and NO more resources are yet to arrive, there is no initial attack time.

5.  If the combined forces have sufficient productivity to not be overrun, THEN the initial attack time is set and the race is afoot.

From the above discussion, it becomes more apparent why the resource arrival times, production rates, durations, tactic, and offset are all required to determine the Time of Initial Attack, and therefore fire size and perimeter at initial attack (which isn't necessarily the fire size at first arrival).

Let me know if you have any questions.

- Drafted a response to FAH concerning the CONTAIN module behavior in determining
initial attack time.

LLCP0064 - BatchBehave Task
Oct 22, 2015 - Jan 21, 2016
40 hours
=============================

2015-10-22 through 2016-01-21 (40.0 hours )

During this time period I have completed an offline working version
of the "Batch Behave" as described in "Issue #067 - Adding a Web-Based
Version of Surface for Batch Runs".  Primary features are as follows:

- The application reads a standard Excel worksheet file as input,
and produces an HTML page (file) as output.

- The "Batch Behave" program reads the worksheet looking for Batch
Behave commands, which are indicated by the word "behave" in Column A
of the row, and one of the following subcommands in Column B:
	-- a "title" row adds a title (whose text is in Column C of the
		row) to the output table.  Any number of titles are allowed.
		
	-- a "note" row adds a note (whose text is in Column C of the row)
		to the output cover page.  Any number of notes are allowed.
		
	-- an "output" row specifies an input or output variable to
		appear in the output table.  Column C of the row has the
		well-known variable name. The user can modify the default:
		--- output display variable label (in Column H),
		--- output table column headers (in Columns D and E),
		--- output display units-of-measure (in row Column F), and
		--- output display decimals (in Column G) as desired.
		All specified output variables appear in the output table in
		the	same order they appear in the worksheet, so order of
		appearance is under user control.  The user may in fact
		specify	the same variable to appear multiple times in the
		output,	perhaps to display results in various units of
		measure.
		
	-- a "units" row specifies (in columns C-X) the input units-of-
		measure for each of the input variables .  Only columns with
		non-empty values have their associated variable's units-of-
		measure	modified.  Users can change input units any number
		of time within the worksheet.
		
	-- a "run" row indicates that a new set of results should be
		generated using the input values specified in columns C-X.
		An input value is modified only if it has a non-blank value
		in its column.  Thus, one "input" row can specify values
		for all its variables, and the following "input" row only
		needs to specify values for inputs whose values change.
		A complete set out Behave results are calculated and stored
		internally for each "run" command.

- Batch Behave supports the following Behave Modules:
	-- Surface (using moisture by size class, wind at midflame)
	-- Size linked to Surface,
	-- Scorch Height linked to Surface, and
	-- Crown Fire linked to Surface (per Scott & Reinhardt)
	
- Outputs include fire behavior at the head, flank, and back of the
	ellipse, and all the intermediate fuel and fire variables.
	
- The entire code base (including all the required fuel and fire
behavior models) has been rewritten in PHP so it can be run directly
on a web server.

- A comprehensive suite of unit tests has been developed to:
	-- support regression testing during development and updating,
	-- ensure identical results with BehavePlus6, and
	-- to guarantee 100% code coverage by the tests.

- All source code is under Git version control and available for download
from http://bitbucket.org/cbevins/batchbehavephp.

The work remaining to be done on Batch Behave includes:
	- setting up a Batch Behave web site and deploying the source
		code and supporting libraries to the site
	- allow the user to upload the input worksheet file
	- display to the user
		-- any errors detected in the input file
		-- the output html table
	-- allow the user to download the results as an html table
	or CSV file for import into Excel.

2015-05-12 (4.0 hours) [21.0 total]

--	Committed Build615 to git repository on bitbucket.org

--	Composed email with download links for FAH.

--	Updated the ReleaseNotes.txt and uploaded them to DropBox.

--	Uploaded installation package to DropBox.

--	Created a new installation package bp_615.msi

--	Added the 12 new HTML help files to wix_bp6_component_docfolder.wxs.

--	Created wix_bp6_product_615.wxs and updated wixcandle.bat
	and wixlight.bat.
	
--	Verified that the surface fire model is correctly using Weise's
	fixed live fuel moisture content of extinction when using the
	special case chaparral fuel models.
	
--	Added ability to estimate (and output) chaparral age from fuel
	depth IF fuel depth, total load, and dead fuel fraction are all
	worksheet inputs.


2015-05-11 (7.0 hours) [17.0 total]

--	Note 1 - The live leaf heat content equation in Rothermel & Philpot
	does not yield the curve displayed in Figure 4.
	
	Note 2 - There is no appreciable fire spread until age 25,
	when calculated live extinction moisture (60%) first exceeds the
	estimated live fuel moisture (52%).  R&P do not state what they
	used for live fuel extinction moisture (or if it was calculated internally).
	
	Note 3 - In the calculation of total load from age,
	Cohen always uses a factor of 0.0347 whereas R&P use 0.0315.
	
	Note 4 - In the calculation of live leaf moisture content, Cohen uses
	a factor of 0.0726 whereas R&P use 0.726.  For Sep 4, Cohen produces
	84.9% while R&P produces 54.6% live leaf moisture content.
	
	Note 5 - Cohen uses a dead extinction moisture 0f 30& while R&P use 20%.
	
	Note 6 - Cohen days since May 1st code contains the statement
		IF (IMONTH .LT. F) IMONTH=11
	which causes indeterminant behavior.
	
	Note 7 - Cohen's algorithm for calculating days since May 1st prdouces
	150 for Sep 30, but 91 for October 1.  So, all live heat and moisture
	contents are suspect or indeterminant.
	
	Note 8 - Cohen's SUBROUTINE INOPT() first sets total load for Mixed Brush and
	then for Chamise> But the code fails to branch after setting the Mixed Brush
	total load,	so all loads are actually for Chamise.
	
	Note 9 : Cohen's SUBROUTINE INOPT() has the statement:
		AMF (2.1) = FMNLV
	which causes indeterminant behavior for live leaf fuel moisture.
	
--	Added all the Chaparral quantity variables to the UnitsEditDialog
	so users can control units of measure and decimal places.
	
--	Added a Run Option for Chaparral special case fule models.

--	Added un/masking of dead fuel moisture inputs for chaparral

--	Corrected several of Cohen's factors back to R&P and FAH values

--	Perform preliminary validation of outputs against R&P figures and
	equations.

--	Adjusted xfblib.cpp and Bp6SurfaceFire.cpp to accept Weise's fixed live
	fuel moisture of extinction values when processing chaparral fuels.
	
--	Verified that BEHAVE 4.4 uses ehn = exp(-138/savr) for live fuel particels

-- While testing the Windows Explorer application launch feature,
discovered that all the fuel moisture scenario files loaded with
the same Description of "TSTMDL (3,4,5,70,70)" instead of the
actual fuel moisture values.  I updated all 16 files so that the
Description now lists the 5 fuel moistures in effect.


2013-03-16 (3.0 h) [17.0 total]

-- Updated the 3 MoistureScenarioFolder/TSTMDL files 1-Low.bpm,
2-Med.bpm, and 3-High.bpm to version 6.

-- Corrected TTSMDL to TSTMDL in wix_bp6_directory.wxs, whixh
was causing Issue #056FAH - New Workspace Cannot be Created.

-- Added a <RemoveFolder Id='DocFolder' On='uninstall'/> line in
wix_bp6_component_executable.wxs to force its removal on uninstall.

-- Added a GUID to "DocFolder\en_US\Html\ScottBurgan12102.png" in
wix_bp6_component_docfolder.wxs so that it and DocFolder should now
get removed during uninstall.

-- Created new builds and uninstalled - reinstalled to verify.

-- RESOLVED ISSUE #056FAH - New Workspace Cannot be Created.

-- Made the following variable name changes:
    "Heat per Unit Area" is now "Surface Heat per Unit Area"
    "Fireline Intensity" is now "Surface Fireline Intensity"
        and column headers are "Surface\nFireline Intensity"
    "Flame Length" is now "Surface Flame Length"
	    and column headers are "Surface\nFlame Length"
	"Crown ROS" is now "Crown Rate of Spread"
	    and column headers  are "Crown Rate\nof Spread"
	The column header for Crown Flamne Length is now "Crown\nFlame Length"

2013-11-05 (4.5 h) [4.5 total]

-- Added call to FuelModelList::fuelModelByModelNumber() inside
EqCalc::unmaskFuelModelInputs() so checks for fuel models first by
name and then by number.

-- Added new function EqTree::tokenConvert() that is called by
EqTree::initRowsFromStore() and EqTree::initColsFromStore()
that checks if fuel model input tokens are actually fuel model
numbers, and if so, converts the tokens to the fuel model name.

-- Drawback of the above is that the fuel model number is now
displayed as the fuel model name on output tables and graphs.
Currently there is no evident way to carry the model number forward
on output displays.


2013-11-06 (2.0 h) [6.5 total]

-- Added code to create 2 fuel models in the fuel model list if
the fuel model name is not the fuel model number.  This nearly
doubles the number of fuel models in the list, but at least fuel
model labels '101' and 'gr1' get displayed, instead of always 'gr1'.

-- Added "FuelBedModel:101" type translations to BehavePlus6.xml
for all the Scott-Burgan models.

-- Modified FuelModelDialog so that it only includes fuel models
whose numbers differ from their codes, but still shows 1-13
and SCALxx series.

-- Resolved Issue 032FAH - SURFACE Module, Fuel Model Selection,
to the extent that (1) users may enter fuel model numbers as well
as codes into the worksheet, and (2) Fuel Model Choice Dialog
headers use standard terminology.  The issue of assigning model
numbers to custom fuel models is deferred to Issue #033.


2013-11-07 (3.5 h) [10.0 total]

-- Added two new variables to BehavePlus6.xml, xeqcalc.h, and
xeqcalc.cpp:
   vSurfaceFuelBedModelCode, "Fuel Model Code", text field
   vSurfaceFuelBedModelNumber, "Fuel Model Number", continuous, 14-256

-- Added the new variables as inputs/outputs in BehavePlus6.xml
function definitions:
  <function name="fSurfaceFuelBedIntermediates"
    input="vSurfaceFuelBedModelCode"
    input="vSurfaceFuelBedModelNumber"
	... />
  <function name="fSurfaceFuelBedModel"
    input="vSurfaceFuelBedModel"
    output="vSurfaceFuelBedModelCode"
    output="vSurfaceFuelBedModelNumber"
    ... />
  <function name="fSurfaceFuelBedParms"
    input="vSurfaceFuelBedModelCode"
    input="vSurfaceFuelBedModelNumber"
	... />

-- The two new variables now get loaded into the equation tree
within EqCalc::FuelBedModel() just like all the other fuel model vars.

-- Added these two variables to the section EqCalc::reconfigureSurfaceModule()
where vSurfaceFuelLoadTransferEq is hidden from the worksheet, under
the assumption that they also need to be hidden whenever 'Fuel Model Type'
needs to be hidden.

-- Added code on EqVar::isValidString() to do special processing for
the two new variables.

-- Added the following lines to each of the SCALxx.bpf files:
  <variable name="vSurfaceFuelBedModelCode" text="SCAL14" />
  <variable name="vSurfaceFuelBedModelNumber" decimals="0" units="" value="14" />

-- Modified FuelModel::loadBpf() to read in the Fuel Model Code and
Fuel Model Number.

-- Changed EqApp::attachFuelModel() to store the Fuel Model Number as the
sort key instead of the Fuel Model Code (or filename).

-- Changed EqApp constructor so that m_fuelModelList no longer adds
leading zeros to fuel model numbers (around line 204).

-- Modified BpDocument::fuelClicked() to append the name of the
selected fuel model to the button text.

-- Fixed the Initialize Fuel From Model Dialog to behave just
as the new Fuel Selection Dialog.

-- RESOLVED ISSUE #033FAH - FARSITE Fuel Model Export, Parts 1 and 2.

    int m_idFileExportFuelModelsFarsiteMetric;   //!< File->Export->Fuel models->Farsite, metric menu item id

-- Added new FARSITE menu items to to AppWindow::initMenuFile().
We now have the required menu/submenu and signal/slot structure.

-- Made the 3 fuel model dialogs (Fuel Model Dialog, Fuel Init Dialog,
and Fuel Export Dialog) more consistent.

-- Added fuel model export to FARSITE in either English and metric units
in FARSITE-conformant format.

-- RESOLVED ISSUE #033FAH - FARSITE Fuel Model Export, Part 4.

-- Build 3 worksheets similar to Pat's (#045PLA) but with outputs
displayed to 6 decimal places, to determine what role rounding may
be playing in the reported issue.  These were saved as run files
FlankTest1.bpr (HEADING), FlankTest2.bpr (FLANKING), and
FlankTest3.bpr (FIRE FRONT with spread direction at head, both
flanks, and back of fire).  The results show that the reported
issue is due solely to the rounding of inputs/outputs between the
3 separate runs that were reported as the issue.

-- I sent an email to Pat explaining the results of this investigation,
and included the 3 run files for her reference.

-- RESOLVED ISSUE #045PLA - Flanking ROS Check.

-- Examined the submitted Issue #043PLA - Contain Diagram Scale
Problem, re-created the run files that reproduce the reported
issue, and performed thorough code examination of
bpcomposecontaindiagram.cpp, using the debugger to step through
and examine all the scaling algorithms and factors.

-- Aside from the cluttered labels on the x-axis of the issue
example, I determined that all scaling was being performed
properly under the current 'feature' contraint.  The current
feature ensures that, if a run has 1 or 2 input range variables
resulting in more than 1 containment diagram, then all the
diagrams should use the same scaling to facilitate user visual
comparison.

-- I drafted an email to Pat and Faith Ann explaining the above
feature, and asking if they want the feature revised so that
each containment diagram within a run gets its own, optimum
scaling.

-- I also reduced the maximum number of tic marks from 12 to 7
to reduce potential axis label clutter.

-- RESOLVED ISSUE #043PLA - Contain Diagram Scale Problem

-- Added "sizeCalcFireDistAtFlank" control to BehavePlus6.xml.

-- Added new logic to EqCalc::reconfigureSizeModule().

-- Added checkbox to SIZE Output Variables tab for
Flanking Spread Distance.

-- Created a new (temporary, NEEDS TO BE EDITED) HTML help file
DocFolder/en_US/Html/vSurfaceFireDistAtFlank.html.

-- Reset the 3 output display control default values to
'false' for the 3 intermediate ellipse variables (f, g, h).
   
-- Tested code using spread units and map units.

-- NOTE that it would now be very easy to add Flanking ROS
and Backing ROS to the SURFACE Basic Outputs.

-- Developed new directory structure for new models (processors)
such as the Active Crown Spotting Model.

-- Reviewed Albini's FORTRAN code to determine best architecture
for developing a C++ version.

-- Created SemFireCrownPlumeBoundaryProcessor.[h|cpp] files in
a first attempt to add in active crown fire spotting functionality.


2013-11-19 (5.0) [57.5 total]

-- Refactored the above code into a new class defined in files
SemFireCrownFirebrandProcessor.[h\cpp]

-- Added in Albini's model algorithms, optimized for single ember
diameter loft height computation by starting from the flame tip
and building the plume as needed until the loft height is reached.


2013-11-20 (7.0 h) [64.5 total]

-- Began debugging the crown fire class.  Uncovered some unexpected
behavior in Albini's adjustment for wind speed at the top of the
canopy.  Composed an email describing the potential issue and sent
it to Faith Ann and Pat for their consideration.

-- Investigated difference between Albini and the new model in the
plume layer selected as the drop out layer.  Determined that
Albini's algorithm selects 1 layer too low.  Because 'qreq' is based
on just the upper boundary zb, it can be satisifed in a layer
that has both an upper and lower boundary 'q' > 'qreq', which
additionally throws off the ensuing interpolation.

-- I made an adjustment for the above issue by calculating 'qreq'
on the average of the upper and lower boundary z levels at each layer.
It now looks like qLower <= q <= qUpper is satisfied for the
selected plume layer.

-- Reviewed and revised above approach and it doesn't always work.
Now we just use the lower boundary conditions of the highest plume
layer that can loft the ember.
 
-- Made corresponding adjustment in dist2a FORTRAN code.

-- Added units editing controls for following variables:
   - vCrownFireCanopyHt
   - vSpotDistActiveCrown
   - vSpotFirebrandHtActiveCrown
   - vSpotFlameHtActiveCrown   
   - vSpotFlatDistActiveCrown
   - vSpotMapDistActiveCrown
   - vSurfaceFireDistAtFlank
   - vSurfaceFireMapDistAtFlank
   - vSurfaceFireSpreadAtFlank
But NOT for:
   - vSpotEmberDiamAtSurface   

-- Because FAH wants user to enter crown fire flame length rather
than crown fireline intensity (when CROWN module is inactive),
we must:
   1 apply the user's crown fire flame length to derive a
     fireline intensity,
   2 submit the fireline intensity to the crown fire spotting model,
   3 which calculates a flame ht above the canopy.
Note that the user's input flame length will differ
from the output flame height.

-- Sent an email to FAH for interpretation on meaning of the
Crown Flame Lenbgth variable.

-- Added following function to xfblib.[cpp|h]:
double FBL_CrownFireFireIntensityFromFlameLength( double crownFireFlameLength )

-- Added <function name="fCrownFireLineIntFromFlameLeng" ... >
to BehavePlus6.xml.

-- Added EqCalc::CrownFireLineIntensityFromFlameLength()
to xeqcalc.[cpp|h].

-- Modified EqCalc::reconfigureSpotModule() to check if any active
crown spotting results are requested when the CROWN Module is
inactive, and if so, to activate the function that back calculates
Crown Fireline Intensity from user input Crown Flame Length.

-- Performed testing of the BP6 worksheet interface and compared
results with parallel runs using 'dist' and 'dist2a' programs.

2013-11-20 (0.5 h) [65.0 total]

-- Responded to FAH email on definition of Crown Flame Length,
and described how we work around it.

-- Sent a new email to FAH asking if it is necessary to
display the 'Downwind Canopy Height' and 'Downwind Canopy
Cover' variables on the worksheet if JUST Active Crown Spot
variables are being requested (i.e., no Burning Pile, Surface
Fire, or Torching Tree spotting is being requested).


2013-11-21 (1.5 h) [66.5 total]

-- Printed and reviewed 4 new Build 608 issues from Pat.

-- Made wording changes to SAFETY Run Option Note

-- RESOLVED ISSUE #047PLA - SAFETY Run Option Note

-- Made capitalization changes to the conflict2 dialog.

test if any of the 5 surface fire spotting model outputs
are being requested by the user.

-- Changed the wording of the SURFACE/SPOT conflict dialog
to reflect V6 spread directions.

-- Re-activated the SURFACE/SPOT COnflict dialog for V6.

-- RESOLVED ISSUE #049 - Restore SPOT Conflict Message


2013-11-21 (6.0 h) [72.5 total]

-- After communicating with FAH, determined that Downwind
Cover Ht and Downwind Canopy Cover are not required for
the Active Crown Fire Spotting Model.

-- Removed following inputs from fSpotDistActiveCrown:
    input="vTreeCoverHtDownwind"
    input="vTreeCanopyCoverDownwind"

-- Removed the downwind variables from EqCalc::SpotDistActiveCrown().

-- Performed 4 series of run comparisons between BP6 and Albini's code
	- Range of canopy heights
	- Range of wind speeds
	- Range of flame lengths/fireline intensities
	- Range of ember diameters
These tests showed agreement between the two programs at precisions
at least as good as 6 significant digits.
	
-- Found an issue in Albini's SUBROUTINE flame() with the lines:
        con = 7.791e-03 * fikwpm / ( utop * htop )
        yhigh = exp( con )
If 'con' exceeds about 40, the binary search never finishes because
yhigh is on the order 1.0e20.  The program doesn not finish even
if yhigh is declared as REAL(8).
However, this problem does not appear to arise in BehavePlus6.


2013-11-21 (1.0 h) [73.5 total]

-- Received and reviewed Issue #051PLA

-- Reviewed code to determine where and when the Choices button
is displayed.  Determined best approach to resolving the issue.

-- Removed the "Choices" button for the following variable by
removing the following wizard assignments in BehavePlus6.xml:
   - vSurfaceFireVectorDirFromUpslope wizard="CompassUpslopeWizard"
   - vSurfaceFireVectorDirFromNorth wizard="compassNorthWizard"
   
-- RESOLVED ISSUE #051PLA - Spread Direction Choise
   
   
2013-11-21 (1.5 h) [75.0 total]

-- Updated the ReleaseNotes.txt file.

-- Recompiled both the debug and release versions of Build 609.

-- Created new WIX scripts and batch files for Build 609.

   - vCrownFireCanopyHt.html
   - vSpotDistActiveCrown.html
   - vSpotEmberDiamAtSurface.html
   - vSpotFirebrandHtActiveCrown.html
   - vSpotFlameHtActiveCrown.html
   - vSpotFlatDistActiveCrown.html
   
-- Created new bp6_609.msi and performed a test installation.

-- Uploaded bp6_609.msi and ReleaseNotes.txt to the DropBox
download site.   

-- Sent an email to Pat and Faith Ann with links to the downloads.

2013-07-23 (2)

--	Worked on Wix script to detect USFS computers and set the
default installation path accordingly.


2013-07-24 (4)

--	Completed wix_bp6_dialog_installdir.wxs.

--	Added ability to clean up leftover working files
when uninstalled.
	
--	Completed testing of installation script for both
USFS and non-USFS machines.
	
2013-07-24 (2)

--	Loaded and unzipped Albini's crown spotting FORTRAN code 
onto the BehavePlus development machine.
	
--	Performed quick review of code structure.

--	Compiled and ran WIND.EXE

--	Compiled and ran PLUMPLT.EXE

--	Compiled and ran PLTDRIFT.EXE

--	Compiled and ran DIST.EXE


2013-07-26 (4.5)

--	Began developing user interface for Albini's Crown Fire Spotting
Model Calculator.  This is a tab view containing:
	- an inputs tabb with a form of min/max/step spin boxes for
		entering all run inputs
	- an outputs tab with a QTableView for displaying all outputs
	
--	Added buttons to Calculate and Quit with signal/slot callbacks
to display the results table.


2013-08-02 (3.5)

--	Added resizeable layout for Albini's Crown Fire Spotting Distance
input tab form.
	
--	Added resizeable output and column-specific formatting to the
output tab results table.
	
--	Added a progress bar that is displayed during calculation.


2013-08-03 (1.0)

--	Created basic class method/data structure for
Albini spot model.


2013-08-04 (5.0)

--	Translated Albini's DIST.FOR FORTRAN model into the
C++ Qt Spot class.

--	Achieved successful compilation of Spot class.


2013-08-05 (8.0)

--	Located MinGw fortran compiler and supporting run time
libraries, recompiled DIST.FOR and performed a few test runs.
	
--	Verified that the C++ Spot class is producing numbers
identical to Albini's FORTRAN model.
	
--	Determined that Albini's FORTRAN model is not producing a
monotonic relationship between increasing ember diameter size
and decreasing vertical loft.  I reported this issue to Faith
Ann Heinsch via email.
	
--	Refactored the MainWindow and Spot classes for uniform naming
convention.
	
--	Refactored the results display table.

--	Added units selector radio box to the input form and added
signal/slot cnnections to update the input units labels.
	
--	Added run counter to the input form and added signal/slot
connections to dynamically update it.


2013-08-06 (3.0)

--	In resposne to an email from FAH, I began investigating the
underlying cause of the the non-monotonic inverse relationship
between ember diameter and crown fire spotting distance.

--	Modified Albini's DIST2.FOR code to print intermediate
results to help identify when the non-monotonic behavior occurs.

--	Isolated a case demonstrating the above issue.  The unexpected
increase in spotting distance when the ember diameter increases
occurs when the ember's loft hieght decreases to a lower vertical
plume layer.


2013-08-07 (6.5)

--	Created newer dist2.for that provides:
	- more detailed intermediate output on the plume and firebrand
		loft characteristics,
	- produces cvs files of plume and firebrand loft characteristics
		for viewing, plotting, and printing in MS Excel,
	- has additional comments documenting variables and processes,
	- allows the user to specify plume layer depth as an input parameter,
	- includes all the various code modules in a single file.
Completed testing and debugging of dist2.


2013-08-08 (5.0)

--	Wrote a report to FAH on the causes of the non-mononic behavior.

--	Fixed a bug in Albini's zi interpolation code which resulted in
a reduced magnitude of the problem, but did not fix the underlying cause.
This new program is	named 'dist2b' (for dist2 Bevins interpolation),
and the original is now named 'dist2a' (for dist2 Albini interpolation).
	
--	Created a new program, 'dist3', that for every ember diameter,
dynamically builds and 'climbs' the plume until it finds the drop
out height.  This results in the expected monotonic behavior between
ember diameter and loft height.  There is still a discontinuous jump
between plume height layers, but that is mitigated by reducing the
vertical step size from 0.20 m to 0.001 m.
	
--	Created a zip file with dist, dist2a, dist2b, and dist3 executables,
source code, and supporting runtime libraries.  Also included example
output Excel files demonstrating the issues and fixes.


2013-08-09 (4.5)

--	Cleaned up the code in dist, dist2a, dist2b, and dist3.

--	Re-drafted the report to FAH to better explain the issues and fixes.
	
--	Recreated the output files demonstrating the model issues.

--	Recreated the zip file and sent it along with the report to FAH.


2013-08-18 (2.0)

--	Began identifing the various models within Albini's crown fire model
(wind speed profiles, plume layers, flame tip, within-plume loft height
 and distance, down-wind spotting distance) and developing code to
 support the calculator requested by FAH.
 
 
 2013-08-19 (4.0)
 
 --	 Developed supporting Variant classes formodeling the crown fire behavior.

2013-05-08 (2.5)

--	Met with Pat Andrews and Faith Ann Heinsch at Fire Lab to discuss
	work roles, project coordination, task request and review procedures,
	and possible updates/upgrades for BehavePlus 6.	


2013-07-15 (1.5)

--	Met with Faith Ann Heinsch to go over her set of change requests
	to be implemented on BehavePlus6.
	- Faith Ann submitted Issues #018FAH through #035FAH to be resolved
	- Collin added the issue of upgrading from the old, deprecated,
		unsupported Wise INstallation System to the new Wix system that
		produces Microsoft Installer .msi packages.

2013-07-16 (3)

--	Begin migration of BehavePlus installation from the Wise Installation
	System to the Microsoft Installer system using the Wix Tools.
	This way the new installation package & process gets tested with
	each new Build submitted to testers.
	
--	Downloaded the Wix Tools for creating .msi installation	packages
	for BehavePlus 6 and installed them on the development computer.

--	Reviewed the Wix documentation and began BehavePlus6 script development.

--	Worked on getting the above bare-bones installation scripts to
	 correctly install at the expected locations, and to result in
	a successful BehavePlus6 startup.
	
--	Verified that BehavePlus6 installation now results in a 
	successful BehavePlus6 launch at the following install sites:
	- c:\Behave\BehavePlus6
	- c:\Users\Owner\BehavePlus
	- Dekstop Icon
	- Program Menu Dir (i.e., Win 8 Applications Search)

--	Verified that BehavePlus6 installation does NOT work below
	C:\ProgramFiles because new files (e.g., log, composer, etc)
	cannot be created without Admin privilege.

--	We now have a successful bare-bones BehavePlus6 installation
	package.  The next step is to develop the user interface portion
	of the installer script to detect USFS computers, provide
	additional installation guidance, use BehavePlus images, etc.


2013-07-20 (3)

--	Began working on Wix installer dialogs by for a BehavePlus
	branded installation package by creating the Wildfire images
	that appear as the dialog banners and images.

		assigned to vSurfaceFireVectorBetaFromUpslope or
		to vSUrfaceFireVectorPsiFromUpslope depending upon whether
		user has selected Beta-based or Psi-based direction.
	--	The vSurfaceFireSpreadAtVector is assigned from either
		vSurfaceFireSpreadAtBeta or vSurfaceFireSpreadAtPsi based upon
		whether beta-based or psi-based directions.

	either fSurfaceFireLineIntAtVectorFromPsi or fSurfaceFireLineIntAtVectorFromBeta.
	
--	All downstream variables that depended on vSurfaceFireLineIntAtVector
	continue to use it as before; but it can now hold either a Beta-based
	or a Psi-based fireline intensity depending on the Surface Module Directions
	tab configuration.
	
-- Created a new function fSurfaceFireFlameLengAtBeta:
	-- input vSurfaceFireLineIntAtBeta
	-- output vSurfaceFireFlameLengAtBeta
	
-- Created a new function fSurfaceFireFlameLengAtPsi:
	-- input vSurfaceFireLineIntAtPsi

2012-06-04 (3)

--	Sent an email to Pat with Build 604 download link.

--	Uploaded bp_604.exe to public Drop Box.

--	Executed the installation script and tested the installed program
	to verify Build 604 installs and runs ok.
	
--	Compiled the Wise installation script into an installation package.

--	Created new behaveplus604.wse Wise installation script

--	Rebuilt and tested Build 604 Release version.

--	Rebuilt and tested Build 604 Debug version.

--	Added a Run Option Note when fire spread is from the Ignition Point
	to indicate if fireline intensity and flame length are based on Beta.
	
--	Verified that Psi-based spread, fireline intensity, and flame length
	are under Units Dialog control.


2012-06-01 (4)
	
--	Added a lot of code to bpdocument.cpp (line 2155) to accomodate the
	multiple pairing and syncing of the rx variables  and their ranges for:
	-- fire spread, fireline intensity, and flame length
	-- vs head, beta, and psi.
	
--	Added following Rx vars to EqTree constructor (xeqtree.cpp line 237):
    -- m_rxVarList->add( m_eqCalc->vSurfaceFireSpreadAtPsi ) ;
    -- m_rxVarList->add( m_eqCalc->vSurfaceFireLineIntAtPsi ) ;
    -- m_rxVarList->add( m_eqCalc->vSurfaceFireFlameLengAtPsi ) ;

	"from north" v "from upslope" options.
	
--	Changed the run options are requested by Pat's notes
	of 3/19/2012 and 3/22/2012.
	

2012-05-31 (5)

--	Verified That all vector directions, RoS, FLI, and FL values
	match the Build 602 benchmark for:
	-- fire spread in specified directions from Ignition Pt (Beta FLI & FL)
	-- fire spread in specified directions from Ignition Pt (Psi FLI & FL)
	-- fire spread in specified directions from Fire Front
	-- fire spread at head only
	-- fire spread at back only
	-- fire spread at flank only
	
--	Completed fixing all the Beta, Theta, and Psi vector issues
	pertaining to compass wrap-around (or lack thereof).
	
	
2012-05-30 (3)

--	Made adjustments to quadrant boundaries in
	FBL_SurfaceFireEllipseBetaFromThetaRadians() to ensure a smooth
	transition across boundaries.  The previous boundaries were off
	by about 4-5 degrees.
	
--	Resolved quadrant issue, which was located in
	FBL_SurfaceFireEllipseThetaFromPsiRadians() where the qudrant tests:
		if ( psiRadians <= 0.5 * M_PI )
		else if ( psiRadians > 0.5* M_PI && psiradians <= 1.5 * M_PI )
		else if ( psiRadians > 1.5 * M_PI )
	needed to be changed to:
		if ( psiRadians < 0.5 * M_PI )
		else if ( psiRadians >= 0.5* M_PI && psiRadians < 1.5 * M_PI )
		else if ( psiRadians >= 1.5 * M_PI )
	
2012-05-29 (4)

--	There is an error in the function that genberates Beta from Psi;
	we need to make appropriate quadrant adjustments.

--	Updated the EqCalc::reconfigureSurfaceModule() function to output
	the Beta vector if the Psi vector already is the row header column and
	'Psi-vector' is selected as ouput from the 'Intermediate Dir' tab.
	That is, we will get Psi and Beta vectors, rather than redundant
	Psi vectors in the first 2 columns.

--	Updated the EqCalc::reconfigureSurfaceModule() function to properly
	generate 'Fire Spread is from Fire Front' variables.

--	Confirmed that the 'Fire Spread from Ignition Point (Psi FLI & FL)'
	option produces the same Beta RoS, Beta FLI, and Beta FL as the
	Build 603 benchmark.

--	Updated the EqCalc::reconfigureSurfaceModule() function to properly
	generate Psi-based FLI and FL.

--	Confirmed that the 'Fire Spread from Ignition Point (Beta FLI & FL)'
	option produces the same Beta RoS, Beta FLI, and Beta FL as the
	Build 603 benchmark.

	--  double FBL_SurfaceFireEllipseBetaFromThetaDegrees()
	--  double FBL_SurfaceFireEllipseBetaFromThetaRadians()
	--	double FBL_SurfaceFireEllipseThetaFromPsiDegrees()
	--  double FBL_SurfaceFireEllipseThetaFromPsiRadians()

--	Results of spread from Ignition Pt (Beta) match previous
	builds as expected.  Other runs have issues to be resolved.
	Need a way to go from psi-based input directions to beta-based.
	
--	Ran preliminary tests of spread from Ignition Pt (Beta),
	Ignition Pt (Psi), and Fire Front.
	
	
2010-05-24 (2)

--	Made the "wind limit" run option the first to be displayed on the worksheet.

--	Obtained successful compilation and linking, and ready for very initial,
	preliminary testing and debugging.
	
--	Implemented new interface dependencies in EqCalc::reconfigureSurfaceModule()
	by adding/changing several hundred lines of code.

--	Added EqCalc::FireLineIntAtVectorFromPsi() and fSurfaceFireLineIntAtVectorFromPsi
	to xeqcalc.cpp and xeqcalc.h.

--	Modified EqCalc::FireLineIntAtPsi() to take vSurfaceFireReactionInt and
	vSurfaceFireResidenceTime instead of vSurfaceFireLineIntAtVector
	to avoid circular dependency when swapping vSurfaceFireLineIntAtPsi into
	vSurfaceFireLineIntAtVector.  This circular dependency is manifested
	when the user selects beta-based (Igntion Point) directions, but wants
	psi-based (Fire Front) fireline intensity and flame length.  That's because
	vSurfaceFireLineIntAtPsi used to take vSurfaceFireLineIntAtVector as input.
	
--	Worked on the beta-psi dependencies and worksheet
	configuration issues associated with the new user interface options.
	
	
2012-05-09 (5)

--	To make the SURFACE Directions tab easier to fit and read,
	--	disabled Pat's last button box
	--	added the following text keys for the Spread Direction:
		-- PropertyTabDialog:Surface:Dir:Spread:PointSourcePsi
		-- PropertyTabDialog:Surface:Dir:Spread:PointSourceBeta
	--	Added following configuration variables to BehavePlus6.xml:
		-- surfaceConfSpreadDirPointSourcePsi (true)
		-- surfaceConfSpreadDirPointSourceBeta (false)
	
--	Modified ModulesDialog::surfaceOptions() to use the new
	SURFACE "Directions" tab.

--	Added following text keys for SURFACE "Directions" tab:
	-- PropertyTabDialog:Surface:Dir:Spread:Head
	-- PropertyTabDialog:Surface:Dir:Spread:Back
	-- PropertyTabDialog:Surface:Dir:Spread:Flank
	-- PropertyTabDialog:Surface:Dir:Spread:PointSource

	-- PropertyTabDialog:Surface:Dir:Beta:Caption
	-- PropertyTabDialog:Surface:Dir:Beta:Beta
	-- PropertyTabDialog:Surface:Dir:Beta:Psi
	
--	Added following configuration variables to BehavePlus6.xml:
	-- surfaceConfSpreadDirHead (true)
	-- surfaceConfSpreadDirBack (false)
	-- surfaceConfSpreadDirFlank (false)
	-- surfaceConfSpreadDirPointSource (false)
	-- surfaceConfSpreadDirFireFront (false)
	-- surfaceConfSpreadDirBetaBeta (false)
	-- surfaceConfSpreadDirBetaPsi (true)

--	Removed SURFACE "Basic Outputs" tab "Fire Characteristics Chart"
	as requested on Pat's notes of 3/19/2012.
	
--	Changed SURFACE "Basic Outputs" tab from "Beta Spread Distance
	from Ignition Pt" to "Surface Spread Distance" as requested
	on Pat's notes of 3/19/2012.
	
--	Changed SURFACE "Fire Front Outputs" tab to "Intermediate Dir"
	(BehavePlus6.xml and moduelesdialog.cpp) as requested on Pat's
	notes from 3/19/2012.


2012-05-08 (1)

--	Disabled the vSurfaceFireEffWindAtVector variable within
	EqCalc::reconfigureSurfaceModule() so that only the effective
	wind speed at the fire head is displayed.
	(Issue #013 - Effective WInd Speed)

--	This appears to resolve Issue 012 - Fire Front Input Variables


2012-05-07 (6)

--	Inside EqCalc::reconfigureSurfaceModule() the vSurfaceFireElapsedTime
	is set as a constant 1 for all Psi-related computations.  But it is
	reset to an input variable if any of the following are requested as outputs:
		Variable Name				Worksheet toggle name		Module
	 -- vCrownFireSpreadDist		crownCalcCrownSpreadDist	CROWN
	 -- vSurfaceFireDistAtBack		sizeCalcFireDistAtBack		SIZE
	 -- vSurfaceFireDistAtHead		sizeCalcFireDistAtFront		SIZE
	 -- vSurfaceFireDistAtPsi		surfaceCalcFireDistAtPsi	SURFACE
	 -- vSurfaceFireDistAtVector	surfaceCalcFireDist			SURFACE
	 -- vSurfaceFireLengDist		sizeCalcFireLengDist		SIZE
	 -- vSurfaceFireShapeDiagram	sizeCalcFireShapeDiagram	SIZE
	 -- vSurfaceFireWidthDist		sizeCalcFireWidthDist		SIZE

--	Activated fSurfaceFireDistAtPsi and fSurfaceFireMapDistAtPsi.

--	Created EqCalc::FireDistAtPsi()

--	Created EqCalc::FireMapDistAtPsi()

--	Issue #011 - Length to Width Ratio Error EXPLAINED
	When using the SURFACE Module, the wind speed limit is applied
	for each fuel model used.  This limits the effective wind speed,
	which limits the length-to-width ratio.
	
	When SURFACE is off and SIZE is active, there is no wind speed limit,
	so the efective wind and length-to-width ratio continue to increase
	with wind speed.
	(Issue #011 - Lenth-to-Width Ratio Error)

--	Modified QString EqApp::findProducerModule( const QString &varName )
	in xeqapp.cpp to test for vSurfaceFireLengthToWidth and
	vSurfaceFireDistAtHead, and force their module to be "SIZE".
	(Issue #010 - Module name with output variables).

--	Updated BehavePlus6.cpp to Build 604.
